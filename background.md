## Web development
I started off with [web development](http://www.learnin60seconds.com/static/tgportfolio/index.html) with projects including tic tac toe game, [Pixabay Docs Add on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixabay-free-images/joobpkaagmlbkkcijfepmlieedgmmdbj), word cloud generator etc. 
## Grow with Google
During the GWG course I further improved my [citizenship civics test app](https://github.com/tanyagupta/offline-uscitizenship-flashcards) and worked on two group proiects including a [navigation app](https://github.com/tanyagupta/Navi) using offline first strategy and google maps api and another one offline first [app](https://github.com/tanyagupta/gwg-women-techmakers) that provides useful information based on geolocation 
## Designing voice user interfaces
After the course, I moved from designing user interfaces to voice user interfaces - and published an [alexa skill based on the New York time movie reviews](https://www.amazon.com/New-York-Times-Movie-Reviews/dp/B07RFKF6T5). To do this I needed to launch a secure EC2 instance, create and execute a Lambda and deploy the application. Here is the [code](https://github.com/tanyagupta/worldbankgroupfactskills) - note I had to later switch out the data base at the back end but it is essentially the same project. 
## Natural Language Processing
From voice user interfaces, I moved to the engine and delved into deep learning/AI by going through the [exercises in the NLTK book](https://github.com/tanyagupta/nlp) and am currently working on my first nlp project - 
[an automated review writer](https://github.com/tanyagupta/review-writer) .
